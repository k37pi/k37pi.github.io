            <h3 class = "hcol">For the chord progs, lowercase alphabet means minor, and uppercase means major.</h3>
            <h3 class = "hcol">The song is in B minor for the most part. The verse has chord progression G-D-e-D with some variations.</h3>
            <h3 class = "hcol">The chorus(?) has chord progression b-A-e-D (and then G-f#-c#dim-D-b) with some variations as well. The solos go over the same two progressions.</h3>
            <h3 class = "hcol">I have first recorded the progressions on an acoustic guitar.</h3>
            <h3 class = "hcol">Then I have played the recording back on my amp, over which I play an electric guitar.</h3>
            <h3 class = "hcol">I think this is called double tracking.</h3>
            <h3 class = "hcol">The 1st demo is sort of going forward and the 2nd one in reverse (not chord wise) if it makes sense. </h3>
            <h3 class = "hcol">The longer one is just demo1 after demo2. Please excuse some bum notes. Please use earphones if possible.</h3>
